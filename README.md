# FPS VR Game
The game is a First Person Shooter game built for Oculus Go. It currently has one level of easy to medium difficulty. 

## Game Play
The user controls the player character movement using the Oculus handset. The player must navigate through the rooms and kill enemies by shooting at them before reaching the final door to win the game. The player has limited bullets but can re-stock on them by accessing ammo boxes around the scene. The enemies also attack the player, hence the player must keep track of health.

## Running the game
The final build for the game can be found under "Builds" as "final.apk". The game must be pushed to an Oculus Go device, which can be done by using an adb software. 

## Key Features
- Automatic tracking of player by enemies
- Enemies shoot back whenever shot at
- Multiple rooms to navigate through
- Ammo boxes to restock on bullets
